YajHFC FAQ
==========

Q: When trying to view sent faxes I always get an error message saying 
   "File format PCL not supported.", although all the documents are PostScript/PDF.
A:
Check the "Use PCL file type bugfix" checkbox in the Options dialog and try again.
Some HylaFAX versions incorrectly report a file type of "PCL" for all documents
associated with a job. If this checkbox is checked, YajHFC tries to guess the
file type using the extension if PCL is reported (which usually works pretty well).


Q: Where do I get a fax viewer for Windows?
A: 
Generally you can use any program that can display TIFF files, although 
some of them display faxes in low resolution with an incorrect (half) height.

Luckily, all recent Windows versions come with program that does this correctly:
- Windows 95/98/ME/2000: You can use the Accessories/Imaging application.
      To use it with YajHFC, use the browse button of the "Command line for fax viewer"
      box to browse for kodakimg.exe on your hard drive
      (this file usually resides either in the Windows directory (Win 98/ME) or
       in "Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\ImageVue" (Win 2k))
- Windows XP: You can use the integrates "picture and fax viewer" (sorry, don't know
      how this is exactly called in English).
      To use it, enter the following text into the "Command line for fax viewer" box:
      rundll32.exe shimgvw.dll,ImageView_Fullscreen %s

      
Q: Where do I get a fax viewer for Linux/*BSD/... ?
A:
"kfax" works very well for me, but just as with Windows, you may use any program that 
can display TIFF files, just search your distribution's package database 
(xloadimage does *not* work for me, however).


Q: What should I use as a fax viewer on Mac OS X?
A:
Just enter "open %s" into the "Command line for fax viewer" box.
The faxes should open in the default application now.
Thanks to Scott Harris for figuring this out.


Q: Where do I get a Postscript viewer?
A:
Windows: Use Ghostview from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
Linux/*BSD/...: Just install one of the Postscript viewer packages
                (e.g. gv, kghostview, gnome-gv, ...)
	

Q: How can I edit cover page templates?
A:
The templates have to be in the same special Postscript format the Hylafax 
"faxcover" program uses. See the follwing pages for hints how to create/edit
such files:

Q: Why are passwords stored in clear text?
A:
Simply because there isn't any method that is much better.
YajHFC could encode/"encrypt" them somehow before storing, but if it did, 
you could always look at the source code to find out how to decrypt them.
(even if YajHFC was closed source software you could still disassemble it
or experiment a bit to find that out).
The only secure method would require you to enter a master password every time
you start YajHFC, but in my opinion that would not provide a improvement over
entering the "real" password.


Q: What does the column XYZ mean?
A:
Most likely, I don't know exactly either, because the column descriptions
are simply copied from the faxstat(1) man page (JobFmt/RcvFmt) and 
abbreviated/translated.


Q: Why did you choose that stupid name?
A:
YajHFC started out as a "test project" for Java and the gnu.hylafax library and so
it didn't have a "nice" name. After working at it for a while, I noticed that it turned 
out to be actually useable, so I chose to give it a name.
Because I was also playing around with SuSE's yast at that point of time and I knew there
were/are already a lot of other java hylafax clients out there, I called it
"yet another" java hylafax client.
