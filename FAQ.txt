YajHFC FAQ
==========

Q: Where do I get a fax viewer for Windows?
A: 
Generally you can use any program that can display TIFF files, although 
some of them display faxes in low resolution with an incorrect (half) height.

Luckily, all recent Windows versions come with program that does this correctly:
- Windows 95/98/ME/2000: You can use the Accessories/Imaging application.
      To use it with YajHFC, use the browse button of the "Command line for fax viewer"
      box to browse for kodakimg.exe on your hard drive
      (this file usually resides either in the Windows directory (Win 98/ME) or
       in "Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\ImageVue" (Win 2k))
- Windows XP: You can use the integrates "picture and fax viewer" (sorry, don't know
      how this is exactly called in English).
      To use it, enter the following text into the "Command line for fax viewer" box:
      rundll32.exe shimgvw.dll,ImageView_Fullscreen %s

      
Q: Where do I get a fax viewer for Linux/*BSD/... ?
A:
"kfax" works very well for me, but just as with Windows, you may use any program that 
can display TIFF files, just search your distribution's package database 
(xloadimage does *not* work for me, however).


Q: Where do I get a Postscript viewer?
A:
Windows: Use Ghostview from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
Linux/*BSD/...: Just install one of the Postscript viewer packages
                (e.g. gv, kghostview, gnome-gv, ...)
	

Q: How can I edit cover page templates?
A:
The templates have to be in the same special Postscript format the Hylafax 
"faxcover" program uses. See the follwing pages for hints how to create/edit
such files:

Q: What does the column XYZ mean?
A:
Most likely, I don't know exactly either, because the column descriptions
are simply copied from the faxstat(1) man page (JobFmt/RcvFmt) and 
abbreviated/translated.


Q: Why did you choose that stupid name?
A:
YajHFC started out as a "test project" for Java and the gnu.hylafax library and so
it didn't have a "nice" name. After working at it for a while, I noticed that it turned 
out to be actually useable, so I chose to give it a name.
Because I was also playing around with SuSE's yast at that point of time and I knew there
were/are already a lot of other java hylafax clients out there, I called it
"yet another" java hylafax client.
