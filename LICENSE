The software in this package is distributed under the GNU General Public License (with a special exception described below).

A copy of GNU General Public License (GPL) is included in this distribution, in the file COPYING.  If you do not have the source code, it is available at:     <http://www.yajhfc.de>   

Linking YajHFC statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on YajHFC. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of YajHFC give you permission to combine YajHFC with modules that are loaded using the YajHFC plugin interface as long as such plugins do not attempt to change the application's name (for example they may not change the main window title bar and may not replace or change the About dialog).
You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for YajHFC and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of YajHFC are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.

YajHFC also contains other code distributed under other terms. External libraries included with YajHFC may also be distributed under different licensing terms. The location and the exact terms of this other code is mentioned below if applicable. 
If code is not listed below, but has a different license statement at the start of the source file, the license statement at the start of the source file defines the license for the respective file.
