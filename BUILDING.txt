Building YajHFC from source
===========================

1. Required software packages
-----------------------------

You will need to have the following software packages installed to build YajHFC:

- A Java JDK, version >= 1.5.0 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads)
- Apache Ant, version >= 1.6.2 (http://ant.apache.org/)
- The gnu.hylafax library (either the version from the YajHFC homepage or from http://gnu-hylafax.sourceforge.net/)

If you want to build YajHFC from CVS or modify translations, you will also need:
- GNU gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

If you want to modify the documentation, you will also need:
- pdflatex (i.e. from TeTeX, also see http://www.tug.org/)
- latex2html (http://www.latex2html.org/)


2. Build instructions
---------------------

To build YajHFC, simply go to the source directory (the directory where build.xml
and this file reside in) and invoke the following command:

ant dist

This compiles YajHFC and creates the JAR file build/yajhfc.jar.
That file can be used just like a jar downloaded from the YajHFC homepage.

NOTES:
~~~~~~
a)
The build file expects to find the gnu.hylafax library in the directory
../gnu.hylafax/ (relative to the source directory). It is also expected to
find the compiled .class files "directly" below this directory 
(i.e. ../gnu-hylafax/gnu/hylafax/HylaFAXClient.class must exist).

If you have installed the library somewhere else, you have to set the gnu.hylafax-dir property 
at the ant command line, e.g. if it is installed in ~/java/gnu-hylafax, use:

ant -Dgnu.hylafax-dir=~/java/gnu-hylafax dist

If you use the library from http://gnu-hylafax.sourceforge.net/ you have to specify the
"build" subdirectory here (e.g. -Dgnu.hylafax-dir=~/java/gnu.hylafax-0.0.9/build).

b) 
Currently building the documentation and the translations only works on a Unix-like system
because a shell script is used in the build process (yajhfc/i18n/fmtall.sh and
doc/faq-src/buildfaq.sh respectively). Creating Windows batch (or VBS/JScript) files with 
the same functionality should be possible, however.
Please also note that this is only a problem if you want to build YajHFC from CVS
(or modify docs/translations) as the source archive contains precompiled
translations and documentation.
