Building YajHFC from source
===========================

1. Required software packages
-----------------------------

You will need to have the following software packages installed to build YajHFC:

- A Java JDK, version >= 1.6.0 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads)
- Apache Ant, version >= 1.7.0 (http://ant.apache.org/)
- The gnu.hylafax library (http://gnu-hylafax.sourceforge.net/)

If you want to build YajHFC from CVS or modify translations, you will also need:
- GNU gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

If you want to modify the documentation, you will also need:
- pdflatex (i.e. from TeTeX, also see http://www.tug.org/)
- latex2html (http://www.latex2html.org/)


2. Build instructions
---------------------

To build YajHFC, go to the source directory (the directory where build.xml
and this file reside in) and perform the following steps:

i)
Edit the file build.properties to specify the location of the gnu.hylafax library.
Usually you only have to set the gnu.hylafax-dir property to do so.
If the build file insists that the library can not be found, please see note a) below.

ii)
Invoke the following command:

ant dist

This compiles YajHFC and creates the JAR file build/yajhfc.jar.
That file can be used just like a jar downloaded from the YajHFC homepage.

NOTES:
~~~~~~
a)
Currently the build file supports two layouts of the gnu.hylafax directory (the build file 
automatically detects which one to use):

i) "Class file directory":
In this case it is expected to find the compiled .class files "directly" below the directory 
(i.e. ${gnu.hylafax-dir}/gnu/hylafax/HylaFAXClient.class must exist).


ii) JARs:
In this case it is expected to find both the files ${gnu.hylafax-dir}/lib/gnu-hylafax-core-*.jar
and ${gnu.hylafax-dir}/lib/gnu-hylafax-inet-ftp-*.jar.

"*" in the name above is just a normal wildcard (to make it independent from the actual version
of the library; for example the files will actually be named "gnu-hylafax-inet-ftp-1.0.0-b2.jar"
and "gnu-hylafax-core-1.0.0-b2.jar").

When you have downloaded a distribution from http://gnu-hylafax.sourceforge.net
usually layout (ii) will be used.
If you are sure that you have specified the right directory in build.properties
and the JARs are still not found, please try setting gnu.hylafax-jar-core and
gnu.hylafax-jar-inet-ftp, too.

b) 
Currently building the documentation and the translations only works on a Unix-like system
because a shell script is used in the build process (yajhfc/i18n/fmtall.sh and
doc/faq-src/buildfaq.sh respectively). Creating Windows batch (or VBS/JScript) files with 
the same functionality should be possible, however.
Please also note that this is only a problem if you want to build YajHFC from CVS
(or modify docs/translations) as the source archive contains precompiled
translations and documentation.
